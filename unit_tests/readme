The unit tests can be run by executing the following command from the main directory:

python ./unit_tests/unit_tests.py

The unit tests are divided into 4 separate classes, each class tests one of the functions in the following order:
- get_joke_api()
- get_joke_type()
- get_joke()
- joke_machine_runner()

The idea behind these tests is to make sure that each one of the above mentioned functions works as expected under different circumstances (different input values).

I have implemented a class called MockResponse to mock the requests.models.Response object.
All the API calls to "https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Any?safe-mode" are mocked in these tests.
MockResponse implements the basic property "status_code" which is in common with the requests.models.Response object,
and the method json(), which returns the json object of the response body.
It is possible to modify the returned value of the json() method by passing some config arguments to MockResponse constructor.
